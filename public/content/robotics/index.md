## What is Robotics?
Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and mathematics to design, build, and operate robots.

Robots are used in:
- **Industrial Automation**: Replacing repetitive tasks in manufacturing.
- **Healthcare**: Assisting in surgeries and patient care.
- **Exploration**: Exploring distant planets, underwater environments, or disaster zones.
- **Entertainment**: Animatronics in movies and theme parks.

## Why Study Robotics?
- Robotics fosters innovation and creativity.
- It offers solutions to real-world problems in diverse fields.
- Robotics pushes the boundaries of what machines can achieve.

## Mathematical Foundation
Mathematics plays a vital role in robotics, from designing algorithms to modeling mechanical systems.

Some important equations:
- **Kinematics**:
  $$
  v = r \cdot \omega
  $$
- **Dynamics**:
  $$
  F = ma
  $$
- **Control Systems**:
  $$
  H(s) = \frac{C(s)}{R(s)}
  $$

Letâ€™s dive deeper into the topics!

### **Markdown File Notes**
- Ensure the linked files (e.g., `automation.md`, `ai-in-robotics.md`) exist in the same `/content/robotics/` folder.
- Use relative links (`[Title](file.md)`) for navigation between Markdown files.
- Math expressions are formatted using `$...$` for inline and `$$...$$` for block math. Ensure your Markdown renderer supports this (e.g., with `remark-math`).
